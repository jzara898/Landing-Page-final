# Landing Page Project

This project is a simple landing page that demonstrates dynamic navigation menu building, section highlighting based on viewport position, and smooth scrolling behavior. It is part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

## Project Description

The landing page features a navigation menu that is dynamically built based on the number of sections present on the page. As the user scrolls, the active section is highlighted, and the corresponding navigation link is also highlighted. Clicking on a navigation link will smoothly scroll the page to the corresponding section.

1. Manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model)
2. Working with JavaScript events
3. Building dynamic user interfaces
4. Implementing smooth scrolling behavior
5. Creating responsive layouts with CSS
